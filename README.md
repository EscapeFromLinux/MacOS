  Automates macOS workstation provisioning. Reads credentials and device data from JSON, configures hostnames and network interfaces, installs development tools and applications (Homebrew, Unity Hub, Docker, AppCrypt, Dozer, Keeper Password Manager, Xcode, etc.), customizes the Dock, disables Bluetooth, executes additional AppleScripts, and cleans up system artifacts. Enables rapid, repeatable environment setup for development or deployment.

  Automates router port forwarding setup via Safari using AppleScript and JavaScript injection.
